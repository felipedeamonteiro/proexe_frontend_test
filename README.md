## The application

It's a Soccer squad manager (looks like a little [`Cartola FC`](https://globoesporte.globo.com/cartola-fc/) from Brazil) and you can create teams with lots of descriptions and 10 different field formations. You can choose any player in the world informing its original team and country. These information are real and is acquired from the demo API [https://www.api-football.com/](https://www.api-football.com/).
